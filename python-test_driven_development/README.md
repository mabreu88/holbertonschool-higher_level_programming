Python - Test-driven development

- Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
- Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases

Learning Objectives

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

Requirements

* Python Scripts


- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc


* Python Test Cases


- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!

Tasks

0. Integers addition

Write a function that adds 2 integers.


- a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer
- a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float
- Returns an integer: the addition of a and b
- You are not allowed to import any module

1. Divide a matrix

Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

- matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
- Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message Each row of the matrix must have the same size
- div must be a number (integer or float), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message div must be a number
- div can’t be equal to 0, otherwise raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message division by zero
- All elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places
- Returns a new matrix
- You are not allowed to import any module


2. Say my name

Write a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>

- first_name and last_name must be strings otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message first_name must be a string or last_name must be a string
- You are not allowed to import any module


3. Print square

Write a function that prints a square with the character #.

- size is the size length of the square
- size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
- if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
- if size is a float and is less than 0, raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
- You are not allowed to import any module


4. Text indentation

Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :

- text must be a string, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message text must be a string
- There should be no space at the beginning or at the end of each printed line
- You are not allowed to import any module


5. Max integer - Unittest

Since the beginning you have been creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests. \n

In this task, you will write unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[]):.

- Your test file should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- Your test file should be python files (extension: .py)
- Your test file should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests.6-max_integer_test
- All tests you make must be passable by the function below
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
